##**Image Search Application Using Docker**
##*Overview*
This project demonstrates how to build a Dockerized image search application using gRPC for communication between client and server components. The server utilizes a machine learning model to analyze user queries and return relevant images.

#*System Architecture*
The application consists of two main components:

#*Server:*
Deploys a machine learning model for image analysis.
Responds to client requests with matching images.
#*Client:*
Sends image search queries to the server.
Receives and displays the server's response (image).
#*Prerequisites*
Docker installed and running on your system.
Python 3.9 or higher.

#*Installation*
**Step 1:** Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/image-search-docker.git
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash
**Step 2:** Build Docker Images

Navigate into the project's root directory and build the Docker images for both the server and the client.

cd image-search-docker

# Build server image
docker build -t my-server-image ./server

# Build client image
docker build -t my-client-image ./client
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash
Usage
Step 1: Start the Server

Run the following command to start the server container:

docker run -d --network=host my-server-image
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash
Step 2: Start the Client

Run the following command to start the client container in interactive mode:

docker run -it --network=host -v $PWD:/app my-client-image
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Bash
Inside the client container, enter a query keyword and press enter. The client will send the query to the server, which will return a matching image. The image will be saved to the client directory as image.jpg.

Customization
You can modify the following aspects of the application to suit your needs:

Machine Learning Model: The server's model.py script can be updated to use a different machine learning model for image analysis.
Query Logic: The server's server.py script can be modified to implement different query logic.
Docker Images: The Dockerfiles in the server and client directories can be customized to include additional dependencies or configurations.
Next Steps
Explore integrating a more sophisticated machine learning model for improved image analysis.
Add support for multiple clients to send queries to the server concurrently.
Deploy the application to a cloud platform for scalability and availability.
